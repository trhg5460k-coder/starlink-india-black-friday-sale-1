**Finalizing Component Implementation**

I've refactored my Next.js component's structure in pursuit of pixel-perfect accuracy. The updated design now mirrors the provided HTML more closely, using a grid-based approach. The component features a full-bleed background `Image` with a gradient overlay. The text content is now positioned correctly with the original `padding-left` and `max-width`. The layout is now fully responsive. This will likely be my final version of this component.
